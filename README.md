**Scalable Backend System**

Architected a highly scalable backend system using Spring Boot and RESTful APIs, capable of handling 1,000+ daily transactions while maintaining low latency and high reliability, ensuring seamless service for end-users.

Optimized database operations by designing efficient schemas, creating indexes, and refining complex queries in MySQL/PostgreSQL, resulting in a 40% improvement in database performance for large datasets.

Implemented secure and concurrent user access with OAuth2 authentication and Spring Security, enabling 200+ simultaneous sessions while maintaining strict data privacy and session integrity.

Ensured system reliability and production-readiness through comprehensive manual testing, error handling mechanisms, modular service architecture, and adherence to best engineering practices.

Enhanced API throughput and service responsiveness by 25% via modular service-oriented architecture, efficient request handling, and preliminary load balancing, supporting scalable growth and smooth user interactions.


**Here it is implemented as a Hospital Management System, aprt from that it can be scalable to many systems with the same performance and efficiency provided by the backend system**

HealthFlow is an interactive project, which implements E2E encrypted Hospital Management System. It is developed using Spring Boot, and for security I've implemented Role based access and implemented OAuth2 authentication for secure authentication during login and signup. Implemented transactional methods to reflect the changes in the database provided by PostgreSQL. Postman software is utilised for RESTful API management.
