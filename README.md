HealthFlow is an interactive project, which implements E2E encrypted Hospital Management System. It is developed using Spring Boot, and for security I've implemented Role based access and implemented OAuth2 authentication for secure authentication during login and signup. Implemented transactional methods to reflect the changes in the database provided by PostgreSQL. Postman software is utilised for RESTful API management.
